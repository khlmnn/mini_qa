# About `mini_qa`

`mini_qa` is a toy question-answering program originally written by [Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/).  It uses Google to attempt to answer questions of the form "Who... ?".

An example question is: "Who discovered relativity?"

The design is inspired by the AskMSR system developed by researchers
at Microsoft Research.  The original paper is:

Brill, Lin, Banko, Dumais and Ng, "Data-Intensive Question
Answering" (2001).

The original author of this program, Michael Nielsen, described background to this program
[here](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-to-answer-a-question-a-simple-system/)
and
[here](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/using-evaluation-to-improve-our-question-answering-system/).

The present fork of `mini_qa` was created by [Marco Kuhlmann](http://www.ida.liu.se/~marku61/) for use in a course at [Link√∂ping University](http://www.liu.se/) called [Perspectives on information technology](https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDD39/).
